- Remove exact from searchSubRouteHandler(). Check again to make sure it is always
    called with true.
    - Check to see if exact is for allowing a trailing slash. I think that is what
        it is used for.
    - test four possibilities.
- Test variable and context.Context storage.
- Test non exact trailing slash.
- Add in config option for non exact (trailing slash).
- Do TODOs in test files.
