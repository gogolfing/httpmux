- move benchmarks to httpmux_test package.
- switch implementation to CompareAfterCommonPrefix().
- possibly link variable slices across mux instances.
- check the append methods to make sure invalid state error is being returned where correct. I know segment var node needs to change.
- check code for TODO comments.
